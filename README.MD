# Convolution Neural Network

This repository is a CNN library implemented in C.

Develop in [Intelligent Computation and Applications Laboratory (ICAL)](http://www.ical.tw/), [National University of Kaohsiung](http://www.nuk.edu.tw/bin/home.php).

### Dependences
- [OpenBLAS (Required)](https://www.openblas.net/)
- [LibXML2 (Required)](http://xmlsoft.org/)

### Cross Platform

This library had been tested on the following platform:
- GCC 5.4.0 (Ubuntu 16.04)
- MinGW 6.4.0 x86_64 (Windows 10)
- Visual Studio 2015, MSVC 14.0 (Windows 10)

### TODO
